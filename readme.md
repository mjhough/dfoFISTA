#### Projected gradient descent (special case of FISTA)

This repo implements accelerated projected gradient descent with multiple constraint sets using FISTA and Dykstra's algorithm.

For more information on proximal gradient descent and projected gradient descent, see [here](https://hough.ai/2020/12/03/prox-gd/).
